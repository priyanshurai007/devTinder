/*
ðŸ“˜ appStore.js Revision Notes:

1. configureStore (from Redux Toolkit):
   - Simplifies store setup.
   - Automatically combines multiple reducers and includes default middleware.

2. Reducers:
   - user: Handles user-related state (e.g., login, profile info).
   - feed: Manages the feed/posts visible to user.
   - connection: Stores current userâ€™s connections.
   - request: Tracks connection requests sent/received.

3. Purpose of appStore:
   - Central Redux store holding global state for the entire application.
   - Shared across components via <Provider store={appStore}> in App.jsx.

4. Export:
   - Exported as `appStore` to be used by the Provider in your root component.
